# Silent Error in JavaScript Function: Unexpected Type Coercion and Divide by Zero

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in JavaScript that involves unexpected type coercion and the potential for divide-by-zero errors. The `foo` function is designed to return the result of `a / b`, but it silently fails under certain conditions.

## The Bug
The `foo` function uses strict equality (`===`) to check if either `a` or `b` is equal to `0`. However, JavaScript's type coercion rules can lead to unexpected results. 

Consider the following call:
`foo(0,0)`

While the function intends to immediately return 0 when a or b is 0, it proceeds to the division if either is 0 but represented as a different type, such as the string "0".  More importantly, the function does not explicitly handle the case where b is 0, which will throw an error. In this example, the function reaches a divide-by-zero error, which crashes the application without any useful error message. This silent failure can be hard to debug.

## The Solution
The solution demonstrates how to more robustly handle the edge cases by explicitly checking the type and using a more informative error handling approach. It adds checks to handle division by zero and returns a more helpful error message when invalid input is provided.
